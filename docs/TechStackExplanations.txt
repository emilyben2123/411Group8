Vanilla Javacsript (no frameworks): Frameworks like React have a steep learning curve. We are flexible on this and may adopt new tools as needed.
Node.js : We will be using Node.js for out Framework because it makes it easier for us to interact with our API's. For instance the spotify API we will be demoing today is written with Node.js 
SQLite: We chose a relational database because our data seems relational and weâ€™re not concerned about scaling. SQLite seems to integrate well with Flask and is convenient for small applications because it does not require a server.
