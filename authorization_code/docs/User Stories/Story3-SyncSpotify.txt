3. Log into spotify -> sync playlist 
As a user, I want to be able to log into my Spotify account so that I can save playlists.
I want playlists to be opened in the app. 
If I do not have a spotify account, will ask if you would like to create an account and bring you to spotifyâ€™s create an account page 
When i enter spotify app I want to be prompted with playlists based on my calendar 
Maybe option to keep me logged in to spotify on webpage
